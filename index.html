<img src="signature1.jpeg">
<p><font align="left" size="5px"> LOYA is a grand feast, which leads you on an immersive journey across the vivid north. From the foothills of the Himalayas to the flat terrain of Punjab, to snow-laden Kashmir, Loya is a confluence of flavour, passion and influence, all culminating exquisitely on your plate.

Our search for the authentic and the long-preserved dishes resulted in a gathering of the North’s most cherished recipes. They spotlight the inherent uniqueness and theatrics of time-honoured cooking techniques of the North - the drama of “dhungar” or smoking, the aromatics of “baghar”, in which spices are tempered in hot oil, “dum”, the richness of slow-cooking and the energetic pounding of spices by hand.</p></font>
